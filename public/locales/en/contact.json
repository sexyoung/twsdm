In the future, we plan to apply research outcomes in NTUH and its affiliations via an interactive and visualized intelligence system. Through organizing outreaching events by domestic Obstetrics and Gynecology Associations, hopefully Women with Child Bearing Potential (WCBPs) can access individualized treatment protocols per personal demands."
