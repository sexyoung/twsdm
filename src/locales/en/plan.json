    "text": "Compared with the general population, the success rate of natural conception in females with endometriosis decreases based on the severity of endometriosis. Those with concurrent infertility causes (e.g. bilateral tubal occlusion) may have an even lower success rate of natural conception. However, as the development of in vitro fertilization (IVF) is quite advanced in modern days, those who plan to become pregnant could consult with doctors from the Reproductive Department to schedule a pre-pregnancy physical exam (e.g. hysterosalpingogram (HSG), semen analysis) and establish the most optimal intervention strategy. Below are some brief self-assessment items:",
    "items": [
      "For clients with at least one non-occlusive tube, and whose male partners are without severe infertility issues, they may consider ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination.",
      "For clients with bilateral tubal occlusion or combined with male infertility, or having failed intrauterine insemination several times previously, they may consider ovulation induction and IVF.",
      "For clients who have severe pelvic pain or a large chocolate cyst (which already interferes with ovum pick-up), it is recommended to remove the endometriosis or the ovarian chocolate cyst before starting the reproductive and endocrinological interventions."
